# Quick Start Guide - CTSELF Client Company Onboarding

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- PostgreSQL database running
- Postman (for testing)

### 1. Environment Setup

Ensure your `.env` file has:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:djakshat@localhost:5432/CTself?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET=CT
GMAIL_USER=noreplybnac@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASS=tlly zphv qpjo zjkt
PORT=3000
```

### 2. Database Setup

Run Prisma migrations:
```powershell
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 3. Create a Super Admin (First Time Only)

If you haven't already, create a super admin user:
```powershell
node src/scripts/createSuperAdmin.js
```

Or manually insert into database:
```sql
INSERT INTO "CompanyUser" (name, username, email, password, role, "userType", status)
VALUES ('Super Admin', 'superadmin', 'admin@company.com', 'hashed_password', 'SUPER_ADMIN', 'COMPANY_USER', 'ACTIVE');
```

### 4. Start the Server

```powershell
node src/server.js
```

You should see:
```
Setting up Express server...
Mounting company user routes at /api/company-users
Mounting onboard routes at /api/onboard
Mounting client user routes at /api/client-users
Server running on port 3000
Test URL: http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 5. Test Health Endpoint

In Postman or browser:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Server is running"
}
```

## üìù Testing Workflow

### Step 1: Login as Company User

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/company-users/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "admin@company.com",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

**Save the token** from the response!

### Step 2: Onboard a Client Company

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/onboard/client-company
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_COMPANY_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "companyName": "Test Company Ltd",
  "companyEmail": "contact@testcompany.com",
  "companyMobile": "9876543210",
  "clientType": "PREMIUM",
  "validTill": "2025-12-31",
  "credits": 1000,
  "whatsappEnabled": true,
  "broadcastEnabled": true,
  "alarmEnabled": false,
  "adminName": "Jane Smith",
  "adminEmail": "jane@testcompany.com",
  "adminMobile": "9876543211"
}
```

**Check the console** - the temporary password will be logged (or check email if configured).

### Step 3: Login as Client User

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/client-users/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "jane@testcompany.com",
  "password": "TEMP_PASSWORD_FROM_STEP_2"
}
```

**Save this token** - it's different from the company user token!

### Step 4: Add Another Client User

```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/client-users
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Bob Johnson",
  "email": "bob@testcompany.com",
  "mobile": "9876543212",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

The temporary password will be in the response.

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "User not found" on login
**Solution:** Create a company user first using `createSuperAdmin.js` script

### Issue: "Company is inactive" on client user login
**Solution:** Make sure company status is ACTIVE. Use toggle status API:
```http
PATCH /api/onboard/client-company/:id/status
{ "status": "ACTIVE" }
```

### Issue: Email not sending
**Solution:** 
- Check GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_PASS in .env
- Use Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- For testing, check console logs for temp passwords

### Issue: "Invalid token"
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're using the correct token (company vs client)
- Token might be expired (2h for company, 8h for client)
- Re-login to get a fresh token

### Issue: Database connection error
**Solution:**
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev`

### Database inspection:
```powershell
npx prisma studio
```
Opens GUI to view/edit database records.
